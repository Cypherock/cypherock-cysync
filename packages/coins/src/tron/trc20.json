      "en": "Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency with a value meant to mirror the value of the U.S. dollar. The idea was to create a stable cryptocurrency that can be used like digital dollars. Coins that serve this purpose of being a stable dollar substitute are called “stable coins.” Tether is the most popular stable coin and even acts as a dollar replacement on many popular exchanges! According to their site, Tether converts cash into digital currency, to anchor or “tether” the value of the coin to the price of national currencies like the US dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Like other cryptos it uses blockchain. Unlike other cryptos, it is [according to the official Tether site] “100% backed by USD” (USD is held in reserve). The primary use of Tether is that it offers some stability to the otherwise volatile crypto space and offers liquidity to exchanges who can’t deal in dollars and with banks (for example to the sometimes controversial but leading exchange <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitfinex\">Bitfinex</a>).\r\n\r\nThe digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether. Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that.\r\n\r\nUSDT is fairly simple to use. Once on exchanges like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/poloniex\">Poloniex</a> or Bittrex, it can be used to purchase Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It can be easily transferred from an exchange to any Omni Layer enabled wallet. Tether has no transaction fees, although external wallets and exchanges may charge one. In order to convert USDT to USD and vise versa through the Tether.to Platform, users must pay a small fee. Buying and selling Tether for Bitcoin can be done through a variety of exchanges like the ones mentioned previously or through the Tether.to platform, which also allows the conversion between USD to and from your bank account."

      "en": "Netcoincapital is a blockchain firm founded to strengthen the world's new blockchain system. This coin, known as NCC, attracted a variety of investors during its AirDrop period and eventually entered the world's first tradable exchange, COINSBIT, on August 2, 2021. Introduced the original paper as well as a revised version known as Black Paper. On the other side, a specific fund has been formed for members of this project to conduct various transactions with NCC digital currency, which may generate revenue for the project's participants.\r\n\r\nNetcoincapital  has already finished the first step of its road map, which includes AirDrop and entering the first exchange, and is now moving on to the second phase of its project. The company's wallet will be offered first in this phase of the project, followed by the blockchain that has been launched under the name of Azgard in the team's black paper, Existing blockchain systems should be reduced. However, due to the structure of the blockchain, it may be utilized as a platform for decentralized applications, even with greater display graphics. The card system can be employed in the project's next steps. Another consequence of this blockchain technology is the Silk Gateway, which is a digital currency payment gateway designated after certain credit institutions.\r\n\r\nNetcoincapital  has decided to incorporate artificial intelligence into another discipline of computer science and programming, taking into account the needs of the user, due to the complexity of programming projects in many languages used in this field. This programming language, which can be integrated with the Asgard blockchain technology to build a blockchain-based operating system that is entirely decentralized, will be able to do the programming code automatically using a very simple user interface.\r\n\r\nPreviously, This company has also conducted research in the field of programming, among which we may name source code linked to difficult linear algebra calculations, which is one of the services given by this company to programmers in the high-level Python language.\r\n\r\nBecause of the creation of blockchain, Netcoincapital's programming language and proprietary operating system will continue to be developed to leverage the blockchain operating system, which is the first step toward powerful processors and the utilization of power. This firm is developing a greater computational mind, a processor that, instead of using metals to process data, will use combinations of metals and specific chemical compositions to process data at a higher rate than present systems.\r\n\r\nanother goal that can be achieved Netcoincapital  Group examined the development of special devices based on proprietary processors and the blockchain operating system, announcing that these devices could be similar to today's smartphones, laptops, and tablets, with the exception that Blockchains are completely decentralized and have higher processing power on the platform."

      "en": "CORE MultiChain (Cryptographic Object Resource Engine) is a PoS blockchain 3.0 framework focused on Interoperability, Scalability, and Usability and Privacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORE MultiChain provides advantages over existing and legacy blockchains such as sharding, simplistic blockchain creation and implementation, cross-chain capabilities, and high transaction throughput.\r\nCORE created a decentralized neighbor selection protocol that continuously strives to create optimal peer connections to decrease confirmation latency. The protocol achieves this through constantly analyzing and learning how nodes interact with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nHow Does the CORE Protocol Attract People?\r\n\r\n•Lightweight\r\n•Compatible with the self-interests of each peer, or ability to select the best neighbors\r\n•Robust against adversarial actions: A CORE peer does not need all details about a candidate neighbor to decide whether to connect\r\n•Incentivizes peers to relay blocks promptly.\r\n•Naturally adaptive to varying hash-power\r\n\r\n\r\nCore Multi-Chain is the next generation of blockchain protocol designed to enable legacy, current, and future blockchains to scale and communicate seamlessly. CORE offers a wide variety of possibilities in the blockchain space due to its sharding, interoperability, and central algorithm.\r\nBy providing a fair and secure platform, CORE allows users to regain control over their personal information. The project offers a scalable network featuring functionalities that bypass current blockchain limitations. CORE intends to provide an environment-friendly system that is sustainable, interoperable and provides enhanced throughput. \r\n\r\nHighlights\r\n•Network Efficiency – CORE contains an AI model at the core of its blockchain. This AI Model speeds up the network’s collective transaction processing times and also enables the network to operate under attacks or faults. \r\n•Security – The AI model helps coordinate the nodes on the network while also strengthening security on the CORE blockchain. This is accomplished through the network’s outlier detection protocol, which monitors for unusual behavior. The AI randomly selects nodes to test and gather data, monitoring network activity outside of the norm. In this phase, any corrupt nodes will be identified. \r\n•Transaction Privacy Protection Layer: CORE transaction privacy protection layer (TPPL) adds an extra layer of security and privacy when transacting on its blockchain. This universal layer is applied to every CORE-connected chain and can be applied to the major public blockchains.\r\n•Randomness – The CORE Multi-Chain network combines Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) into a single hybrid solution, thus achieving true Randomness within the network. Randomness influences the difficulty in the mining function of PoW blockchains and periodically chooses the validators in a PoS blockchain.\r\n•Scalability – To address the scalability issue of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, CORE enhanced the consensus mechanism by reducing the communication complexity within standard PBFT implementations to create the Accelerated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (APBFT) consensus mechanism.\r\n\r\nToken Usage\r\n•Through the CMCX token, users can conduct transactions on the CORE blockchain and pay for all utility fees within the ecosystem. Platform users can use the token to participate in governance, stake, transactions, smart contracts, and reward validators.\r\n•Core’s mission is to serve the community. Users can vote for management and developer teams using the native token CORE (CMCX). The CORE community provides projects funding. Users will vote on any proposed changes to the blockchain or platform, creating a community-driven blockchain.\r\n•Through CORE, all blockchains, past and present, will be able to scale and communicate seamlessly with one another by utilizing the CMCX token. \r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-Layered framework design: \r\nCORE is constructed over three layers; ORIGO, CATENA & AURA. Each layer is designed perfectly to get the job done.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGO is the network layer. It is the brain of the system. It handles the formation of the blocks in the blockchain. \r\nCATENA is the blockchain layer and is built on the network layer. This is where the actual blocks form and newly formed blocks are appended.\r\nAURA is the application layer; this is where the DApps and smart contracts are built. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApeirogon blockchain framework\r\nCORE Blockchain combines all the latest frameworks and advanced programming languages into one cutting-edge solution to get more technical. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is built on our in-house Apeirogon blockchain framework, a next-generation framework for enterprise-grade blockchain innovation that is highly compatible with Solidity.\r\nApeirogon is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm), a super-performant virtual environment that provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed.\r\nApeirogon’s ecosystem uses a state-of-the-art peer-to-peer network platform called LibP2P, a modular system of protocols, specifications, and libraries that enable the development of peer-to-peer network applications and is positioned to be the standard for future decentralized applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n Advantages\r\n•Extensive research & value proposition to current blockchain limitations: The Whitepaper available on the Multi-chain website provides an in-depth yet accessible presentation of the responses provided by the team to solve current limitations on scalability, network efficiency, overall security, and reward fairness. CORE Multi-Chain Whitepaper accessible here.\r\n•Security audits available: An audit of the network performed by CERTIK is currently public on the CORE Multi-Chain website. This research documents the project’s performance in the following criteria: Security, Runtime, Documentation, Testing, General, and Transparency.  "

The total supply of ROCK is 5,973,780,169, of which 1.4 billion serves as the reserve fund of ROCK DAO, 0.7 billion held by Gala Games and Huobi each. 1.4 billion ROCK, as a reserve fund, will never enter the secondary market. It works as a governance token that gives holders voting rights. Gala Games also plans to connect with the Tron ecosystem and integrate ROCK with the GALA Games ecosystem. On the other side, Huobi is actively working to promote the interaction between Rock DAO and HT DAO for the mutual empowerment of the communities. Rock will work closely with Huobi and Gala Games to jointly explore the Web3 GameFi ecosystem, enrich the gaming experience, facilitate nodal cooperation and community governance. Gala Games is poised to launch memorial NFTs to ROCK holders exclusively while ROCK will be considered as a reward token in the Gala Games ecosystem. In addition, ROCK can be used to deduct commission fees in the NFT market. In 2023, the Gala Games public chain is set to launch, marking a significant milestone for Gala Film, Gala Music, and the entire Web3 GameFi ecosystem as they transfer onto the public chain. In this ecosystem, ROCK will assume a crucial role.\r\n\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of your project.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat’s next for your project?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\n\r\n"

      "en": "What is WETH (Wrapped ETH)?\r\nWETH is the tokenized/packaged form of ETH that you use to pay for items when you interact with Ethereum dApps. WETH follows the ERC-20 token standards, enabling it to achieve interoperability with other ERC-20 tokens. \r\n\r\nThis offers more utility to holders as they can use it across networks and dApps. You can stake, yield farm, lend, and provide liquidity to various liquidity pools with WETH. \r\n\r\nAlso, unlike ETH, which doesn’t conform to its own ERC-20 standard and thus has lower interoperability as it can’t be used on other chains besides Ethereum, WETH can be used on cheaper and high throughput alternatives like Binance, Polygon, Solana, and Cardano.\r\n\r\nThe price of WETH will always be the same as ETH because it maintains a 1:1 wrapping ratio.\r\n\r\nHow to Wrap ETH?\r\nCustodians wrap and unwrap ETH. To wrap ETH, you send ETH to a custodian. This can be a multi-sig wallet, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), or a smart contract. After connecting your web3 wallet to a DeFi exchange, you enter the amount of ETH you wish to wrap and click the swap function. Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive WETH tokens equivalent to the ETH that you’ve swapped.\r\n\r\nOn a centralized exchange, the exchange burns the deposited ETH and mints a wrapped form for you. And when you want to unwrap it, the exchange will burn the wrapped version and mint the ETH on your behalf.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Next for WETH?\r\nAccording to the developers, hopefully there will be no future for WETH. According to the website, steps are being taken to update ETH to make it compliant with its own ERC-20 standards. "
